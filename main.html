	<h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
	    Time complexity is a way to measure how efficient an algorithm is by analyzing the amount of time it takes to run as the input size increases. Understanding Time complexity helps developers write efficient code and compare different algorithms.

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. It is often expressed using Big-O notation such as O(n), which indicates that memory usage grows linearly with input size.
